# Heuristics
## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and testing various heuristics for machine learning operations (MLOps). The goal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MLOps processes through the use of heuristic methods.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/badquant/practiceMLOPs.git
cd practiceMLOPs/practice_heuristics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the heuristics, execute the following command:

```bash
python fetch_cities_lat_long.py.py 
```
you may also pass the simulations parameter depending on how many simulations you want
